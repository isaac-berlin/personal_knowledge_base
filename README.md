## Overview

### What is this?

This is a collection of notes on various topics. This repository is meant to be a reference for myself and others. It is not meant to be a comprehensive guide on any topic and is intended to give a simple overview of topics such that someone with minimal knowledge could understand what is going on. A variety of topics are covered, mostly related to programming. The notes are written in Markdown and are organized by topic.

### Why?

There are a lot of things that are important to know, but are not necessarily used often enough to remember. This repository contains information and tutorials on how to do things for future reference. It is also a good way to practice writing and documenting things. I also hope that this repository will be useful to others.

## Structure and Organization

These notes are orginized by topic. These topics are each given a directory. Each directory contains a README.md file that contains a brief overview of each note in the directory and a link to it. Each note is named after the topic it covers. For example, the note on Python virtual environments is named `venv.md` and is located in the `Python` directory. The overall directory structure is as follows:

```bash
├── Bash
│   ├── basic_commands.md
├── Git
│   ├── git_workflow.md
├── Python
├── ├── conda.md
│   └── venv.md
└── README.md
```
