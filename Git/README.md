# Git Overview

## Overview of Git

Git is a distributed version control system designed to manage software development projects. It was developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and is now one of the most widely used version control systems in the world.

Git allows developers to collaborate on code and track changes over time. It works by creating a repository of code on a server, which can then be cloned to individual machines for local development. Changes made to the code are tracked and can be committed to the repository, allowing developers to work on different parts of a project simultaneously without conflicts.

Git also provides powerful tools for managing branches and merging code, allowing developers to experiment with different approaches to a problem and easily merge changes back into the main codebase.

Git is used by many organizations, including large software companies, startups, and open-source projects. It has become an essential tool for developers, allowing them to work more efficiently and collaboratively, and ensuring that code is well-documented and easily maintained over time.
